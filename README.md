# Noodles.Fun ‚Äî Feed Your KOLs! üçú

**Noodles.Fun** turns Twitter (X) accounts into special bonding curve tokens. Trade these tokens and use them to pay for promotion services on X, such as shoutouts or pinned tweets. A fun way to support and engage with KOLs!

## How It Works

1. **Every Twitter Account Has a Token:** Each token represents a unique bonding curve for a Twitter (X) account.
2. **Trade Instantly:** Use a bonding curve to buy or sell tokens. No need for liquidity pools or order books.
3. **Spend Tokens for Promotions:** The X account owner can accept tokens as payment for services, such as tweets or pinned posts.

## Development

### Setup

1. Copy environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env_example .env
   ```

2. Install packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile:

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

### Deploy

For example, to deploy to the testnet (with your `.env` file set up properly):

```bash
npm run deploy abstractTestnet
```

### Testing

Run your unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Local Fork Testing

1. **Install Rust** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Build the Local Node**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/era-test-node
   cd era-test-node
   make fetch-contracts && make build-contracts
   make clean && make build-contracts && make rust-build
   ```

   If you see any build errors about `aws-lc-sys`, you might need:

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove gcc-9 && sudo apt install clang
   ```

3. **Run Forked Node**:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/anvil-zksync fork --fork-url https://api.testnet.abs.xyz
   ```

4. **In Another Terminal, Run Tests**:

   ```bash
   npm run test-local
   ```
